# Dislodged
A game I developed for the 1st semester 2025 Game Development Guild game jam at University of Auckland on the theme of "Crash" (+ the 8-bit music was also created by me, not the best at it though). Eventhough we were given 2 months, me getting used to uni and a new country took large part of my time, so this game was developed in 3 full days of work.
In this game your player is from a different world, and thus experiences lag spikes where the player freezes in time. You have to make sure you do not freeze at a time where you are in mid air and right above the void.

It was a fun game to create, but had issues regarding the freezing mechanism as I had to make sure the movement of killing enemies by jumping on them worked well alongside of the player being frozen (lots of debugging and looking at various methods to implement this feature).

Played around with godot shaders and had loads of fun showcasing this game to others during the showcase of the game jam, and to my surprise there were people that completed this horribly hard game.
